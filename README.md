Non-Coders: Multi-Chain Smart Contracts

Developing a multi-chain smart contract on Evmos, or any blockchain platform, typically requires some coding skills or at least a basic understanding of smart contract development. However, if you have zero coding skills, it can be challenging to directly develop a smart contract. Here are some general steps you can take to get started with the development process

1. Learn the Basics of Blockchain and Smart Contracts:
   It's essential to understand the fundamental concepts of blockchain technology and how smart contracts work. Familiarize yourself with terms like consensus mechanisms, decentralized applications (DApps), and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

2. Understand Evmos:
   Evmos is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform, so you need to understand its architecture, features, and development tools. Explore Evmos documentation, developer resources, and community forums to gain a better understanding of the platform.

3. Find Existing Smart Contracts:
   Look for open-source smart contracts that are compatible with Evmos and support multi-chain functionality. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab are good starting points for finding pre-existing smart contracts that you can leverage for your project.

4. Use Smart Contract Generators:
   Several tools and frameworks allow you to generate smart contracts without coding skills. For instance, tools like Truffle or Remix IDE provide a user-friendly interface where you can visually design and deploy smart contracts. Although these tools may not directly support multi-chain functionality, they can help you get started with basic smart contract development.

5. Engage with the Community:
   Join the Evmos community channels, such as forums, Discord, or Telegram groups. Engage with other developers, ask questions, and seek guidance. Many blockchain communities are helpful and supportive, so you can find assistance from experienced developers or even potential collaborators.

6. Collaborate with Developers:
   If you have a project idea but lack coding skills, consider collaborating with developers who are experienced in smart contract development. You can hire freelance developers or seek partnerships within the blockchain community. Clearly communicate your project requirements and find developers willing to work with you.

7. Explore Low-Code Development Platforms:
   While not specific to Evmos, low-code development platforms provide a visual interface to design and deploy smart contracts without extensive coding skills. These platforms abstract the complexities of coding and allow you to focus on the logic and functionality of your smart contract. Research and evaluate low-code platforms that support Ethereum-compatible smart contract development.

Remember, while it's possible to develop a multi-chain smart contract without coding skills, having a basic understanding of programming concepts and smart contract development will greatly assist you in navigating the process and ensuring the quality and security of your contract.
